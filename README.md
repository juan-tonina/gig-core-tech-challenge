# gig-core-tech-challenge


I had an unexpected trip during the weekend, so I finished like 50% of the challenge (I am missing tests, the subscriber and the actual sending of the message through ws 
when receiving from rabbitmq).

Because of my current project, I am (not very happily) using windows, so I would say I lost like 5 hours trying to set up docker (seven million bugs with W10), 
docker-compose (networks are weird in W10) and rabbitmq (the volume did not work, I had to change a couple of things).

I spent like 4 hours reading about Go (never used it before).

I estimate that I would have needed several hours to finish this, probably around 8 hours to finish everything nicely, but it is not an effort I am willing to do now, during the week 
(even if I were given more time to do it, because the due date was today: 2021/8/11).

I upload this and make it public so you can see exactly where I was before my unexpected trip. Today I spent like 1 hour doing the last commit, I think I just added a couple of files and
half of a functionality.

Anyway, in retrospective, I should have just done this in my beatiful debian instead of windows, and I would have probably finished everything in time.

Feel free to go through the code, but as I said in my email: I withdrew my application to this job.

I hope we can stay in touch for future opportunities.
